# Bearlyb
...pronounced "bear-lib" is a in progress game-making library for scala. The goal is to be as simple to get started with as possible, and at the same time have enough performance to make bigger games, following the scala philosophy!

## Inspirations
Pygame is the main inspiration for this engine, but there are some things that will be different about this library. For it would be nice to have a function that provides consistant updates to have a stable framerate as it is non-trivial to do this yourself.
